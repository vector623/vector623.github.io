## A ## 
Agile - A popular software development methodology that solves the problem of misaligned expectations between the
developer and the customer by pretending they don't exist.

Amazon Web Services - A cloud computing service, which labels relatively simple products with complicated-sounding
names, as an enticement for developers to pad their resumes.  A sane developer would never affix "file storage" to his
areas of expertise, but once the file storage has been renamed to "S3", suddenly the boast is worth publishing in a
professional context.

## B ##

Big data - When Excel crashes.

Bitcoin - A digital currency designed to enable ransomware payments.

Bizdev - Job title for a position in web application sales.  Generally preferred by someone who is too proud to be
called a salesman and yet is not shrewd enough to get paid like one.

## C ##

Cloud, as in computing - Another name for someone else's computer.

## D ##

Data Lake - The cloud's version of My Documents.

Data science - Statistics and linear algebra concealed behind a veil of marketing and ignorance.

Devops - A portmanteau of Development and Operations.  In other words, the combined practice of writing software and
publishing it. Devops has recently gained momentum, in large part because it enables developers to evade accountability
by removing all non-developers from the software publishing process.

Docker - An abstraction for Linux system administration and networking.  Allows entry-level developers to apply for
six-figure devops salaries by publishing a Dockerfile to Github.

## E ##

Early Access - A version of Kickstarter for Steam, designed to redirect profits for non-refundable video game preorders
from the former to the latter.

## G ##

Git - A tool that allows a developer to obscure software defects by publishing them in such large volumes as to
quickly overwhelm the sensory faculties of any critics.  See [*Predator Confusion Effect*.][0]

GitHub - Synonymous with Git, for most developers.

Go - A programming language, released by Google, that has gained most of its popularity by making developers feel like 
they are working for Google.

## H ##

Hour of Code - An effort to encourage small children to write software, using the [web page equivalent of a pop up book][1].

## I ##

Initial Coin Offering - a highly lucrative and repeatable exercise, during which a startup company directly inflates 
the money supply of all cryptocurrencies. The profits gained are directly correlated to the consequent devaluation of
all other existing cryptocurriencies.

## J ##

Javascript - see *technical debt*

## M ##

Machine Learning - The brute forcing of relatively data simple insights using graphics cards; an industry-wide attempt 
to compensate for a generational loss of mathematic understanding with PC gaming hardware.

Meddling (as in *Meddling in US Elections*) - A rallying cry uniting the public against Big Tech.

## N ##

Net Neutrality - A rallying cry uniting the public for Big Tech.

Node.js - A platform used by project managers in an attempt to reduce programmer salaries by leveraging a workforce
specially trained in a language designed to defer development costs from today to tomorrow.

## S ##

Serverless - The discarding of a generation's worth of technology intended to standardize web applications in favor of
locking yourself into a vendor with an unproven, proprietary service from Amazon (Lambda), Microsoft (Azure Functions)
or Google (Serverless).
